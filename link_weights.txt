Metrics:
1. Hop count
2. Latencies
3. Packet loss/corruption rate

Reasons for choosing each metric:
1. Hop count:
If each 

Also, if each "hop" has a nontrivial overhead (or some other penalty), then it may be better to choose
2. Latencies:
If link latencies are high
If there are some links with especially high latencies, then it would be the best to avoid these links and take a detour instead

3. Packet loss/corruption rate
If the probability of a packet being dropped/corrupted is significant between each hop, 
then it may be the best choice to 


Network graph:
h1-- s1 -- s2 -- s3 --  h2 
  \_  s4 -----s5---- s6_/ 
  \				       /
   \_  s7 _______ s8 _/
    
Latency table:
s1 - s2, s2 - s3:
s4 - s5, s5 - s6:
s7 - s8:

Every other link has negligible latency, for simplicity


Packet loss/corruption rate:
s1 - s2: 
s2 - s3:


Everything else sends correctly 100% of the time, for simplicity
  
    
Best path between h1 and h2
-By hop count: h1 -> s7 -> s8 -> h2 (simple distance metric)
-By latencies:				(the latencies are ADDED across the links)
-By packet loss/corruption rate:      (the loss rates are MULTIPLIED across the links)
